                        <p><img src="../assets/images/about/About1.jpg" />The project welcomes refugee and migrant communities, local Greeks, and vulnerable people residing on the Greek island of Lesvos to join in and learn how to use industrial sewing machines to craft items by hand and produce stylish shopper bags. The bags, which are all available on our website, are all made from vegan materials and purchased in the town of Mytilene, the capital of Lesvos.</p>
                        <p><img src="../assets/images/about/About2.jpg" />Our team on the ground in Greece consists of the project leader, Christina, the procurement manager, Annie, the media coordinator, Beth, and the founder of our partner organization, Starfish Foundation, Melinda. There are also two tailors who lead production of our beautiful bags. In Switzerland, there is Diana, Olivia and Markus, who are responsible for fundraising and communication. The project is a joint initiative of the Greek non-profit organization Starfish Foundation and the Swiss association #EducationEveryone. All of the donations are reinvested back into the project.</p>

                        <h1>How it started </h1>
                        <p><img src="../assets/images/about/About3.jpg" />The bagforeveryone project began with a woman named Sara. A talented sewer, Sara, had made the dangerous journey over to Europe from Afghanistan in 2018, and it was on the Greek island of Lesvos that Sara met Olivia, a volunteer from Switzerland. Sara proposed an idea to Olivia: she wanted to make bags, using her sewing skills to craft something beautiful, and she wanted to share her skills with others.</p>
                        <p><img src="../assets/images/about/About4.jpg" />Sara later received the positive news that her asylum had been accepted, and she could leave the island of Lesvos for mainland Europe. However, even with her departure from Lesvos, the project and her ideas remain as important as ever. The project allows anyone residing on Lesvos- from refugee and migrant communities living within the camp, to local Greek people, and vulnerable groups- to join in and learn from experienced tailors to use industrial sewing machines; it is a project which centres on the development of people’s skill sets, and the need to break down barriers between communities on Lesvos.</p>

                        <h1>Workshops</h1>
                        <p><img src="../assets/images/about/About5.jpg" />The bagforeveryone project has been designed to bring local communities on Lesvos together by learning the skill of sewing. Two instructors conduct the sewing workshops, where they teach each student how to use industrial sewing machines. The students progress from learning basic sewing skills, to advanced skills, such as the bagforeveryone shopper bag. Once the students gain the set of skills necessary, they too can teach the lessons to others. </p>
                        <p><img src="../assets/images/about/About6.jpg" />The project provides people with a safe, unique, and friendly space where they can practice sewing techniques and socialise with others. Based in Starfish’s headquarters in Mytilene, named “OpenSpace”, the bagforeveryone initiative brings everyone- from those within the refugee and migrant communities, to local Greek people on Lesvos, and vulnerable groups- together to learn practical sewing and tailoring skills, and encourage them to teach sewing classes themselves.  bagforeveryone project has been designed to bring local communities on Lesvos together by learning the skill of sewing.
