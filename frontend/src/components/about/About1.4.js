Two instructors conduct the sewing workshops, where they teach each student how to use industrial sewing machines. The students progress from learning basic sewing skills, to advanced skills, such as the bagforeveryone shopper bag. Once the students gain the set of skills necessary, they too can teach the lessons to others. </p>

Based in Starfish’s headquarters in Mytilene, named “OpenSpace”, the bagforeveryone initiative brings everyone- from those within the refugee and migrant communities, to local Greek people on Lesvos, and vulnerable groups- together to learn practical sewing and tailoring skills, and encourage them to teach sewing classes themselves.  bagforeveryone project has been designed to bring local communities on Lesvos together by learning the skill of sewing.
